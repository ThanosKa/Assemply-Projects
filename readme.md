**Data Structures**

Implemented the *linked-list* on this project using *assemply*.
Each of the node is consists of two words of 32 bits each  (because *RARS* simulates the 32-bit RISC-V
The linked list two fields, the *data* and the * *nxtPtr*

**How it works**

Run  the programm and simply
1)insert *positive*  **INTS** in to the list.
2)When you finish  insert  0 or *negative* integer to exit the Insert function
3)Insert a **posivite** integer  to print the  datas on the list  larger than the integer you inserted
4)insert  *negative* integer to terminate the programm
